[features]
# Use https://crates.io/crates/libc for the platform abstraction. This simplifies
# cross-compilation since bindgen is not required anymore. Unfortunately, the libc crate
# does not offer all the functionality iceoryx2 requires on all of the supported
# platforms. Therefore, only a subset of the supported platforms will work with this
# feature flag.
