# Publish-Subscribe With User Header

## Running The Example

> [!CAUTION]
> Every payload you transmit with iceoryx2 must be compatible with shared
> memory. Specifically, it must:
>
> * be self contained, no heap, no pointers to external sources
> * have a uniform memory representation -> `#[repr(C)]`
> * not use pointers to manage their internal structure
> * the type and no member implements `Drop` explicitly
>
> Data types like `String` or `Vec` will cause undefined behavior and may
> result in segmentation faults. We provide alternative data types that are
> compatible with shared memory. See the
> [complex data type example](../complex_data_types) for guidance on how to
> use them.

This example illustrates a publisher-subscriber communication pattern between
two separate processes with an additional user header, referred to as a
`CustomHeader`. The publisher sends messages every second, each containing an
incrementing number and the `CustomHeader`, which includes an additional version
number and a timestamp. On the receiving end, the subscriber checks for new data
every second and prints out the received payload and the user header.

To observe this dynamic communication in action, open two separate terminals and
execute the following commands:

### Terminal 1

```sh
cargo run --example publish_subscribe_user_header_subscriber
```

### Terminal 2

```sh
cargo run --example publish_subscribe_user_header_publisher
```

Feel free to run multiple instances of the publisher or subscriber processes
simultaneously to explore how iceoryx2 handles publisher-subscriber
communication efficiently.

You may hit the maximum supported number of ports when too many publisher or
subscriber processes are running. Check the [iceoryx2 config](../../../config)
to set the limits globally or refer to the
[API of the Service builder](https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/service/index.html)
to set them for a single service.
