# Publish-Subscribe

> [!CAUTION]
> Every payload you transmit with iceoryx2 must be compatible with shared
> memory. Specifically, it must:
>
> * be self contained, no heap, no pointers to external sources
> * have a uniform memory representation, ensuring that shared structs have the
>     same data layout
> * not use pointers to manage their internal structure

This example illustrates a robust publisher-subscriber communication pattern
between two separate processes. The publisher sends two messages every second,
each containing [`TransmissionData`]. On the receiving end, the subscriber
checks for new data every second.

The subscriber is printing the sample on the console whenever new data arrives.

## How to Build

Before proceeding, all dependencies need to be installed. You can find
instructions in the [C Examples Readme](../README.md).

First you have to build the C examples:

```sh
cmake -S . -B target/ffi/build -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_CXX_BINDING=OFF
cmake --build target/ffi/build
```

## How to Run

To observe this dynamic communication in action, open two separate terminals and
execute the following commands:

### Terminal 1

```sh
./target/ffi/build/examples/c/publish_subscribe/example_c_publish_subscribe_subscriber
```

### Terminal 2

```sh
./target/ffi/build/examples/c/publish_subscribe/example_c_publish_subscribe_publisher
```

Feel free to run multiple instances of publisher or subscriber processes
simultaneously to explore how iceoryx2 handles publisher-subscriber
communication efficiently.

You may hit the maximum supported number of ports when too many publisher or
subscriber processes run. Take a look at the [iceoryx2 config](../../../config)
to set the limits globally or at the
[API of the Service builder](https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/service/index.html)
to set them for a single service.
