# Publish-Subscribe

> [!CAUTION]
> Every payload you transmit with iceoryx2 must be compatible with shared
> memory. Specifically, it must:
>
> * be self contained, no heap, no pointers to external sources
> * have a uniform memory representation, ensuring that shared structs have the
>     same data layout
>     * therefore, only `ctypes` and `ctypes.Structure` can be transferred
> * not use pointers to manage their internal structure
>
> Any other python data type, except `ctypes` or `ctypes.Structure`s, like will
> cause undefined behavior and may result in segmentation faults.

This example illustrates a robust publisher-subscriber communication pattern
between two separate processes. The publisher sends a message every second,
each containing [`TransmissionData`]. On the receiving end, the subscriber
checks for new data every second.

The subscriber is printing the sample on the console whenever new data arrives.

## How to Build

Before proceeding, a virtual environment with all dependencies needs to be
created. You can find the detailed instructions in the
[Python Examples Readme](../README.md).

```sh
poetry --project iceoryx2-ffi/python install
```

Then, the iceoryx2 python bindings can be built and installed into the virtual
environment:

```sh
poetry --project iceoryx2-ffi/python run maturin develop --manifest-path iceoryx2-ffi/python/Cargo.toml --target-dir target/ffi/python
```

## How to Run

To observe this dynamic communication in action, open two separate terminals
and execute the following commands:

### Terminal 1

```sh
poetry --project iceoryx2-ffi/python run python examples/python/publish_subscribe/subscriber.py
```

### Terminal 2

```sh
poetry --project iceoryx2-ffi/python run python examples/python/publish_subscribe/publisher.py
```

Feel free to run multiple instances of publisher or subscriber processes
simultaneously to explore how iceoryx2 handles publisher-subscriber
communication efficiently.

> [!TIP]
> You may hit the maximum supported number of ports when too many publisher or
> subscriber processes run. Take a look at the
> [iceoryx2 config](../../../config) to set the limits globally or at the
> [API of the Service builder](https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/service/index.html)
> to set them for a single service.
