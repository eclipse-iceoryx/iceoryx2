This example demonstrates iceoryx2's event multiplexing mechanism,
called the `WaitSet`. It allows waiting, with a single call, on
multiple `Listener` ports as well as external file descriptor-based
events such as `sockets`.

In this setup, the `wait` process monitors two services, which the
user can specify via the command line option `-s` and `-t`.
The `notifier` can define the service to which it will send event
notifications using the `-s` option and specify the event ID with
the `-e` option.

## How to Build

Before proceeding, all dependencies need to be installed. You can find
instructions in the [C++ Examples Readme](../README.md).

First you have to build the C++ examples:

```sh
cmake -S . -B target/ffi/c-cxx/build -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build target/ffi/c-cxx/build
```

## How to Run

In the example below, we are waiting for events on the services `fuu` and
`bar`. Service `fuu` is notified with event ID `123`, and service `bar` is
notified with event ID `456`.

### Terminal 1

```sh
./target/ffi/c-cxx/build/examples/cxx/event_multiplexing/example_cxx_event_multiplexing_wait -s fuu -t bar
```

### Terminal 2

```sh
./target/ffi/c-cxx/build/examples/cxx/event_multiplexing/example_cxx_event_multiplexing_notifier -s "fuu" -e 123
```

### Terminal 3

```sh
./target/ffi/c-cxx/build/examples/cxx/event_multiplexing/example_cxx_event_multiplexing_notifier -s "bar" -e 456
```

Feel free to instantiate multiple notifiers for the same service with the same
or different event id's. Or to for different services.

## Technical Details

The `WaitSet` utilizes `epoll`, `select`, or other event-multiplexing
mechanisms. Before the `WaitSet` can monitor a specific event, it must first be
attached using `WaitSet::attach_notification()`, which returns a RAII `Guard`.
This `Guard` automatically detaches the attachment when it goes out of scope.

The `WaitSet::wait_and_process()` call requires a closure that is invoked for
each triggered attachment and provides the `AttachmentId`. The user can either
use `AttachmentId::has_event_from($ATTACHED_OBJECT$)` to identify the object
associated with the `AttachmentId`, or set up a
`std::map::<AttachmentId, Listener<ipc::Service>>` to quickly access the
corresponding object.
