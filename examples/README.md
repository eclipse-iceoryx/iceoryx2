## Foundations of Communication in iceoryx2 Applications

In the world of iceoryx2, communication is at the core of everything. To
facilitate seamless communication, we always begin by opening or creating a
service, the fundamental building block of an iceoryx2 application. Services
serve as the conduit through which different parts of your application interact.

The type of service you create is defined by a messaging pattern, which dictates
how data flows between participants. iceoryx2 supports various messaging
patterns, including:

* **Publish-Subscribe:** In this pattern, a publisher sends a continuous stream
  of data to one or more subscribers, enabling real-time data dissemination.

* **Event:** This pattern allows notifiers to trigger events on a listener,
  which waits until it receives a notification. It is the basic pattern for
  implementing push-notifications.

* **Request-Response:** This pattern enables clients to send requests
  to a server, which responds with the requested data or action, making it
  suitable for interactive, transactional communication.

* **Blackboard (in progress):** This pattern realizes a key-value store in
  shared memory which can be modified by one writer and several readers.

* **Pipeline:** (planned) Borrowed from the Unix command line, this pattern
  involves a data source that produces data and transfers ownership to a sink,
  where it can be modified or processed in a pipeline-like fashion.

The service acts as a factory, creating service participants, often called
"ports." These ports establish communication links between different components
of your application. Each service can be customized with specific settings to
meet your application's requirements.

Within the service builder, you can configure various service-specific quality
of service parameters, ensuring that your communication behaves precisely as you
intend. The service port factory allows you to fine-tune the settings and
behavior of individual ports, giving you precise control over how they interact
and exchange data.

## Payload Type Restrictions

> [!CAUTION]
> iceoryx2 stores payload data in shared memory, which imposes the restriction that
> the payload type must be self-contained and cannot use heap memory. Additionally,
> internal pointers are not allowed because the shared memory is mapped at different
> offsets in each process, making absolute pointers invalid and potentially leading
> to segmentation faults.
>
> Furthermore, every data type must be annotated with `#[repr(C)]`. The Rust
> compiler may reorder the members of a struct, which can lead to undefined
> behavior if another process expects a different ordering.

To address these limitations, we provide data types that are compatible with shared
memory. For Rust, we offer:

* `FixedSizeByteString`
* `FixedSizeVec`

For C++, we provide:

* `iox::vector`
* `iox::string`
* `iox::list`

These types are demonstrated in the complex data types example.
