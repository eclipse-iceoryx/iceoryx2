    <td align="center" valign="top" width="14.28%">
    <a href="https://github.com/$USER_NAME$">
    <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/$ID_OF_YOUR_PROFILE_PICTURE$" width="120px;" alt="$FIRST_NAME$ »$COOL_NICK_NAME$« $LAST_NAME$"/><br />

    **Notes:**
     * The `$FIRST_NAME »$COOL_NICK_NAME$« $LAST_NAME$` is a suggestion but it can
       be whatever you feel comfortable with.
     * You can obtain the ID of your profile picture by clicking on your profile
        icon on the top right, selecting `Your profile` and then right-clicking on
        your profile picture and selecting `Copy image address`. The last number in
        the URL is the ID of your profile picture.
